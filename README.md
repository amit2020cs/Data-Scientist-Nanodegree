## Dog breed classifier using CNN and Transfer Learning
## Project Overview
In this project, the code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
